Beyond it, the striking crimson of the Shiromibashi bridge contrasts beautifully with the water, as an elegant Wasen (traditional Japanese boat) glides peacefully along the inner moat. In the background, the majestic white Main Keep (Daitenshu) towers calmly against the spring sky. The composition of these elements overlapping in perfect harmony is truly breathtaking.\n\nTucked away slightly, this hidden viewpoint buzzes with a quiet, passionate energy during the few days the cherry blossoms are at their peak. If you head near the zoo, you will easily spot the exact location by the crowd of photographers with their cameras ready.",
